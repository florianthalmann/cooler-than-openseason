        <p><strong>Yo producer, are you cooler than Open Season?</strong></p>
        <p>For one of our new songs we need you to make it way more awesome! Sign up and record your own personal sounds on your smartphone, your computer,
        or even in your fancy-ass studio. You will find a number of tracks with suggestive names where you can press record again and again,
        until your fussy ears are satisfied. At any stage, you can listen to the current version by pressing the 'Play Song' button.</p>
