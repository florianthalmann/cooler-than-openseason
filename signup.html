        <p><strong>Yo producer, are you cooler than Open Season?</strong></p>
        <p>We need YOU to make one of our new songs way more awesome!</p>
        <p>Sign up and record your own sounds on your smartphone, your computer, or even in your fancy-ass studio.
        Or go find sounds outside and around you, and show us what you got!
        </p>
        <p>For each of the tracks with suggestive names, press record again and again and experiment until your picky ears are satisfied.
        Each of the sounds will automagically appear somewhere in the song.
        </p>
        <p>If your sounds please our ears more than anyone else's,
        they will be featured in the official version and you will have a chance to appear in the official music video!
        What are you waiting for? Get started already!
