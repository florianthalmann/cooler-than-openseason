        <p><strong>Yo producer, are you cooler than Open Season?</strong></p>
        <p>We need YOU to make one of our new songs way more awesome!</p>
        <p>Sign up and record your own sounds on your smartphone, your computer, or even in your fancy studio.
        Or go find sounds outside and around you, and show us what you've got!
        </p>
        <p>Can you record the perfect bassdrum, snare, clap, hey, yeah, and more? Go on and press the record buttons over and over again and experiment until your delicate ears are satisfied.
        Each of the sounds will automagically appear somewhere in the song.
        </p>
        <p>
